Hash table method is trying to set up an new array by the relationship between the indices and the elements from the input array. Through so-called hash function, the indices become the element of the new array and the elements(processed or compressed by hash function) become the indices of the new array. Tracking the address of compressed elements in the new arra to locate where the orignal index is in the input array reduce time consumption and algorithm complexity. Additionally, Hash table is a collection of all the addresses of those input indices.
